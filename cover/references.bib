	abstract={A major challenge to long read sequencing data is their high error rate of up to 15{\%}. We present Ratatosk, a method to correct long reads with short read data. We demonstrate on 5 human genome trios that Ratatosk reduces the error rate of long reads 6-fold on average with a median error rate as low as 0.22 {\%}. SNP calls in Ratatosk corrected reads are nearly 99 {\%} accurate and indel calls accuracy is increased by up to 37 {\%}. An assembly of Ratatosk corrected reads from an Ashkenazi individual yields a contig N50 of 45 Mbp and less misassemblies than a PacBio HiFi reads assembly.},
