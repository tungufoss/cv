\entry{2022}{Panelist}{3rd European Language Resource Coordination (ELRC) workshop in Iceland}{
As a panelist at the \href{https://lr-coordination.eu/iceland3rd}{third Icelandic ELRC workshop}, I discussed the impact of Language Technology and AI on the Icelandic language with other developers, integrators, and users. We explored the potential of Language Technology to transform digital interactions in both private and public sectors and shared our experiences and perspectives on its current status and future prospects. The discussion was engaging and provided valuable insights into the role of Language Technology in shaping our multilingual future.}

I, along with two of my friends, co-hosted an Icelandic podcast where we read all 47 books in The Legend of the Ice People series by Margit Sandemo. Additionally, I curated a segment on Internet cats at the end of each episode. The podcast was originally published by Alvarpið from 2017-18, but was later moved to Storytel Iceland in March 2019.}
