Philip Runarsson. The main focus of the study is on Job Shop Scheduling 
Problems (JSP) and Flow Shop Problems (FSP) and how to automate the scheduling 
process using e.g. ordinal regression. Moreover, I inspected ``problem 
difficulty'' and ``algorithm's footprints in instance space''. \\

{\emph{Detection of Fouling: Effectiveness Ratio Method} \\ 
The dissertation investigated the possibility of using models to detect fouling in a cross-flow heat exchangers, by only using measurements that are attainable in normal operation of the heat exchanger.  The on-line detection of fouling is used by a new and more general method that also takes into account that the input can be varying. \\
The new method finds a threshold for fouling based on the estimate of the steady states of the effectiveness, which is done by applying a wavelet transform since the transform is localised in both time and frequency. \\
The parameters of the method need to be chosen carefully, e.g. compromise between the frequency and time localisation, thus a multiple objective genetic algorithm is implemented for the optimisation. }

	Worked on a recommendation engine service for new characters playing in EVE Online based on their in-game behaviour. This involved developing new real-time time-series features using information from proto-events from either redis or kafka streams. Feature engineering used TimescaleDB extension for pgSQL functions. Moreover, developed ad-hoc metrics to quantify content quality and its engagement to these new recommendation models.

    I was in charge of implementing and maintaining the Oxford Nanopore Technologies long range sequencing analysis pipeline for start of ONT sequencing at deCODE. 
    I worked closely with the lab department in deciding the protocol from LIMS to work with the downstream analysis. Along with collaborating with the ITO in making necessary changes to our cluster and disk architecture in order to process the exuberant amount of data (roughly 6 petabyte over past three years) in an efficient manner, in terms of computational cost (cpu and gpu hours) and most importantly assuring data integrity.
