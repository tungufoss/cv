{\emph{Postdoctoral Researcher}. \\
I am currently part of the research team for the Intelligent Decision Learning Models (IDeLM) project, funded by the Rannis Research Fund. The project aims to develop intelligent decision-making models through the application of machine learning and data analytics techniques, with the goal of enhancing decision-making processes in various domains. My responsibilities on the project include conducting research, analyzing data, developing machine learning models, and collaborating with the team to achieve project objectives.

{\emph{Sessional Teacher} in Business Intelligence (\href{https://ugla.hi.is/kennsluskra/index.php?tab=nam&chapter=namskeid&id=71001420230}{IDN610M}). \\
As a lecturer for the Business Intelligence course, I taught 3rd year BSc and 1st year MSc students the practical applications of supervised learning, clustering, and process mining using real-world data. My project-driven approach and emphasis on active participation helped students develop practical skills such as effective use of GitHub and technical report writing. By the end of the course, students gained a solid understanding of key machine learning techniques and their use cases, preparing them for success in their future careers.

{\emph{Sessional Teacher} in Operations Research (\href{https://ugla.hi.is/kennsluskra/index.php?sid=&tab=nam&chapter=namskeid&id=08213020110}{IDN401G})\\
As the sole instructor, I took pride in teaching the undergraduate course on Operations Research during the spring semesters of 2011 and 2012. I worked diligently with Gudrun Geirsdottir at the School of Education to restructure the course, including assignments, grading, and tests.\\
I am particularly proud of my efforts in innovating the course design, assessment, and evaluations of tutorials, which resulted in inspiring a fellow teacher in Natural Sciences. Together, we were able to secure a teaching grant from the University to further develop our methods, and I was honored to have played a part in that success.\\
Overall, I am pleased with the work I did in the course and the grant we received, as they are testaments to my dedication to teaching and my ability to think creatively and collaboratively to achieve positive outcomes.
