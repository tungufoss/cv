{Ph.D. {\normalfont of Computational Engineering}}
{The University of Iceland, Reykjavik}
{Conducted research on hyperheuristics with guidance from Prof. Tómas Philip Rúnarsson. Focused on automating the scheduling process for Job Shop Scheduling Problems using ordinal regression and analyzed the ``problem difficulty'' and ``algorithm's footprints in instance space'' for such optimization problems. Awarded a doctoral grant from the University of Iceland Research Fund. \\
